Sure, here's the algorithm for the Link State Protocol in simple words:

Input the number of nodes in the network (n) and the cost between each pair of nodes.

Initialize the distance of each node to a very large value and mark all nodes as unvisited.

Set the distance of the source node to 0.

Repeat the following steps n-1 times:

a. Find the node with the minimum distance among the unvisited nodes.

b. Mark that node as visited.

c. Update the distance of all unvisited neighbors if a shorter path is found, and remember the previous node on the path.

Print the routing table for the source node, showing the cost to reach each node and the next hop.

Print the cost of the shortest path from the source node to each destination node.

End the program.
